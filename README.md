# üåæ Shambani: Intelligent Crop Recommendation System

> **Empowering farmers with data-driven agricultural intelligence**

---

## üöú Overview

**Shambani** is a machine learning‚Äìpowered agricultural advisory platform that recommends the **most suitable crops** for cultivation based on real environmental and soil parameters.  
By analyzing **Nitrogen (N)**, **Phosphorus (P)**, **Potassium (K)**, **temperature**, **humidity**, **pH**, and **rainfall**, it identifies the crops that thrive best under those specific conditions.

Traditional crop selection methods rely heavily on experience and guesswork. Shambani introduces **precision farming intelligence**‚Äîmaking advanced data science accessible to every farmer through a simple and intuitive web interface.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Agricultural productivity is often limited by poor decision-making around crop choice. Farmers may cultivate crops unsuited to their soil or climate, leading to:
- Low yields and wasted inputs (fertilizers, water, and seeds).
- Increased environmental impact.
- Economic losses due to mismatched crop‚Äìsoil conditions.

The project addresses this challenge by applying **machine learning** to recommend optimal crops for a given environment, thereby improving both **yield quality** and **resource efficiency**.

## üß† Approach & Methodology

1. **Dataset**
   - Sourced from **Kaggle‚Äôs Crop Recommendation Dataset**, which contains ~2,200 samples with features representing key soil nutrients and weather conditions.
   - The dataset is clean, balanced, and representative of typical agricultural data across various crops.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler` ensures uniform contribution of each parameter to the model.
   - Crop names (categorical target) are encoded numerically using `LabelEncoder`.
   - Exploratory analysis (via Seaborn and Matplotlib) is used to study feature distributions and relationships.

3. **Modeling**
   - **XGBoost Classifier** was selected for its:
     - High performance on structured/tabular data.
     - Robustness to feature interactions.
     - Proven reliability in agricultural data applications.
   - The model predicts the most probable crops suitable for given conditions and ranks them by confidence.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Achieved over **95% accuracy** on held-out test data.
   - Evaluated with confusion matrix and standard classification metrics to confirm generalization.

5. **Deployment**
   - Deployed using **Streamlit** for an interactive and lightweight web interface.
   - The model (`crop_model.json`), scaler, and encoder are stored and loaded dynamically for inference.
   - Farmers can input their soil/environmental data and instantly receive top 3 crop recommendations with confidence percentages.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Disclaimer

**Shambani** is an educational and research-oriented project built to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in sustainable agriculture.  
It should not replace professional agronomic advice. Environmental variations, seed quality, and regional factors must be considered before applying model recommendations in real-world cultivation.
